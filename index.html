                <h3 class="orange-color">2022-present | Pro level Developer</h3>
                <p>In the world of software programming, it helps to have someone on the team who is something of a jack
                    of
                    all trades. They can help with various stages of development and have the versatility and time
                    management to assist all levels of the development team. When it comes to web development, that role
                    belongs to the Full Stack Developer. This is not a Back End or Front End developer, but someone who
                    handles both — a “Full Stack,” as it were.</p>

                    <p>A Junior Web Developer works with a team of developers to create new websites and applications.
                        The
                        “junior” designation means you work under the supervision of senior developers in your
                        department,
                        but
                        you may be involved in all stages of the project, from brainstorming to final testing.</p>
